You should be familiar with the "Find the shortest path" problem. But what if moving to a neighboring coordinate counted not as 1 step but as N steps?

INSTRUCTIONS

Your task is to find the path through the field which has the lowest cost to go through.

As input you will receive: 1) a toll_map matrix (as variable t) which holds data about how expensive it is to go through the given field coordinates 2) a start coordinate (tuple) which holds information about your starting position 3) a finish coordinate (tuple) which holds information about the position you have to get to

As output you should return: 1) the directions list
